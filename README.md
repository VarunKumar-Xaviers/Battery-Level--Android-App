# Battery-Level--Android-App
## Short Description
An Android App to View Battery Level of Phone for people with visual impairment and senior citizens.
This app aims to make it easier to view the phone/tablet’s battery %  and charging status in Large Font, Bold Text and Speech.
This is an Open Source Project developed specially for users with visual Impairments in mind. 
## Long Description
People with visual impairments or blindness(Visually Impaired (VI) Community) usually find it difficult to read the status bar information on the Android phone. The status bar shows vital information with the most important being the time and battery percentage. There are many widgets available as part of the android Operating System which show the time in both analog and digital formats and in large fonts. However, there are very few options when it comes to viewing the battery percentage of the phone. This makes it hard for people from the VI community to know the phone’s battery percentage whenever they desire. 

The battery is the most important element in any smart phone and it is usually important to monitor how much charge is left on your phone at any point in time. For example, if you have 20 percent of battery left and you are still a few hours away from home or any power source, you may want to save the battery and keep your phone alive till you can charge it next.

Currently people with visual impairments rely on the phone’s low battery system notification (Usually when the phone reaches 15%) and by then it is often too late to act. This app aims to show the battery percentage in large font and also announce the same using the device’s speaker.

Also, only few smartphones have a sound or vibration notification when the phone starts charging and it is difficult for people with visual impairment to confirm whether the phone is charging or not.  This app also shows the charging status (Charging/Not charging).  

Keep it simple 
The app has been specifically designed to only show the battery percentage and charging status  and does not provide any optimisation features. The aim is to keep it simple and easy to use and to display the most crucial information to the VI users without bombarding the users with a lot of information. The VI community and senior citizens can benefit from the app.
